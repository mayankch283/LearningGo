go cli

go build -> compiles bunch of go source code files
go run -> compiles and executes one or two files
go fmt -> formats all code in each file in the current directory
go install -> compiles and "installs" a package
go get -> downloads raw source code of someone else's package
go test -> runs any tests associated with the project

Package in go is a collection of .go files

package == project == workspace

There are 2 types of packages in golang:
Executable package : generates a file that we can run. Executable packages must have a func main().
Reusable package : code used as 'helpers'/libraries/code dependencies. good place to put reusable logic here.

Q. How do we create an executable package and reusable package?
A. We declare "package main" when we want to make sure that building the file spits out an executable. 

Q. Then why we declare "package main" and not something like "package folder_name"?
A. Because then it wouldn't be an executable package but a reusable package.

Q. what is `import "fmt"`?
A. fmt is another package for formatted I/O. It's a part of the standard library of Go. Basically, imports all functionality of fmt to our main package.


2 ways to initialize a variable:
-> `var identifier data_type = value`
-> `identifier := value` // this is not dynamic. this as well is done at compile time.

NOTE: You can declare a variable outside of all funcs but can't initialize it using :=


declaring a function:
func identifier() return_type{
    //body
    return value_of_return_type
}

NOTE: We can call functions in one file from another file in the SAME package. However, we will have to build the two files with `go build` command first.
